Modular Architecture for Motor-Generator Inverter

1	Scope
Specify a modular architecture for electric motor-generator inverters.
The specification defines:
-	The architecture diagram
-	The functions provides by each block
-	The interfaces between each block: functional, electrical and possibly mechanical (where it make sense)

Therefore this repository is a “documentation only” repository that should be the base for other projects implementing this specification.
Initially, you can get involved by helping to write this specification.
Later you will be able to get involved by designing a block of the inverter.
