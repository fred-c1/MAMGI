All permanent magnet synchronous motors can be used as motor or generator depending on how they are controlled.
***

A rotor position sensor allows to start the motor(-generator) with a higher torque
***

In a 3 phase motor-generator, the sum of the phase current is zero.
Therefore it is possile to measure only 2 phase currents.
***

Phases voltages measurements are usefull in sensorless mode when the phases are not driven by the inverter
***

The phase current sensor is placed direcly in series with phase connection (going to the motor-generator) rather than in serie with low side power switch.
This allows a higher sampling frequency of the phase current and therefore a better control of the motor-generator.
In addition, since the current measurement must be isolated from the phase (due to the high voltage),
there is no additional cost for placing the current sensor directly in series with phase connection.
