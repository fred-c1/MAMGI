All permanent magnet synchronous motors can be used as motor or generator depending on how they are controlled.
***

A rotor position sensor allows to start the motor(-generator) with a higher torque
***

In a 3 phase motor-generator, the sum of the phase current is zero.
Therefore it is possile to measure only 2 phase currents.
***

Phases voltages measurements are usefull in sensorless mode when the phases are not driven by the inverter
***

The phase current sensor is placed direcly in the phase and not in the DC link.
