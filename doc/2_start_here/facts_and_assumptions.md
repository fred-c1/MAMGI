All permanent magnet synchronous motors can be used as motor or generator depending on how they are controlled.


A rotor position sensor allows to start the motor(-generator) with a higher torque


In a 3 phase motor-generator, the sum of the phase current is zero.
Therefore it is possile to measure only 2 phase currents.


Phases voltages measurements are usefull in sensorless mode when the phases are not driven by the inverter
