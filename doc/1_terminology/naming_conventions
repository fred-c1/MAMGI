# differencial voltages/signals
positive => add "_P"
negative => add "_N"
Example = "HVDC_P" = positive terminal of HVDC power

# polarity and name of digital signals
"FAULT" indicates an active high signal
"nFAULT" indicates an active low signal


# high voltage DC power
short = HVDC


# Phases
A 3-phase motor is assumed
Phases are names A, B and C
wire are called PHASE_A, PHASE_B and PHASE_C
