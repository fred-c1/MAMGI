**AC** = Alternating Current
***

**BEMF** = Back EMF = Counter EMF

**BLDC**   (see also PMSM) = BrushLess Direct Current (motor-generator)  
A BLDC a permanent magnet synchronous motor designed to have trapezoidal back EMF 
In order to achieve constant torque we inject square wave currents.
***

**DC** = Direct Current

**EMF** = EletroMotive Force

***

**HV** = High Voltage (the driver block separates/isolates the LV side and the HV side of the inverter)
***

**IGBT** = insulated-gate bipolar transistor

***

**LV** = Low Voltage (the driver block separates/isolates the LV side and the HV side of the inverter)
***

**MOSFET** = metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor

***

**PMSM** (see also BLDC) = Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (-Generator)

A PMSM is designed to have a sinusoidal back EMF
In order to achieve constant torque we inject sinusoidal currents.

**RDC** = Resolver to Digital Converter
***

**RPM** = Revolutions Per Minute
